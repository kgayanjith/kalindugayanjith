export const bio =`Hi, I’m Kalindu Gayanjith, a Full-Stack Developer from Sri
                  Lanka with over 2 years of experience building modern web
                  applications that connect design and technology. I’m
                  passionate about developing solutions that are not only
                  efficient under the hood but also deliver smooth, engaging
                  user experiences. My expertise spans across React, Vue.js,
                  Next.js, Laravel, and MySQL, allowing me to handle
                  everything from front-end interfaces to back-end systems with
                  confidence. I enjoy transforming ideas into scalable,
                  high-performing products that align with real user needs. I
                  hold a BSc (Hons) in Management Information Systems and am
                  currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence, which
                  enables me to combine technical, business, and AI-driven
                  perspectives to build smarter, data-informed solutions. I’m
                  always exploring new tools, improving my workflow, and
                  striving to write code that’s clean, reliable, and built to
                  last.`
